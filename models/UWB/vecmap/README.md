# SemEval2020 Task1 - VecMap

- The embeddings have been mapped using the VecMap tool: https://github.com/artetxem/vecmap

- The target words have been compared with cosine similarity using eval_similarity.py script from VecMap. 
The similarities were printed each on separate line creating the file `data/vecmap/results-lang-type.txt` where `lang` is the language code and `type` is `i` for identical words mapping and `unsup` for the unsupervised one.

- Next we computed the thresholds for the binary task and prepared the results in the standard format: `PrepareResults.java`
